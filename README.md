# ðŸ¤–Blue's Simple Spam Bot

Hello and welcome to my first Github Repo!

This is a very simple spam bot I created using Python 3.

# ðŸ“„Requirements:
There are none! 

# ðŸ’¾Installation:

Just download the latest .zip from releases, unzip, click SpamBot.exe and when it pops up with Windows Smartscreen click more info and run anyway. 
Don't be alarmed, it only says that as the .exe was not published by a verified publisher.

# ðŸ—¨Support:
If you are having any issues contact me on Discord, Bluemethyst#9923
