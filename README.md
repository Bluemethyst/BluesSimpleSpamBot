# ðŸ¤–Blue's Simple Spam Bot

# âš I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACCOUNTS BEING LOST DUE TO SELFBOTTING OR OTHER REASONS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISKâš 

Hello and welcome to my first Github Repo!

This is a very simple spam bot I created using Python 3.

# ðŸ“„Requirements:
There are none! 

# ðŸ’¾Installation:

Just download the latest .zip from releases, unzip, click SpamBot.exe and when it pops up with Windows Smartscreen click more info and run anyway. 
Don't be alarmed, it only says that as the .exe was not published by a verified publisher.
